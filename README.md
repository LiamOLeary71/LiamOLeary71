## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Liam O'Leary
I am a freshmen B.S. IT&Cybersecurity major student at Wright State University
two projects i want to work on is a To-Do list 

1. Application that can add a task and add a due date and once completed you can cross it out hopefully I can accomplish it with Java 

2. A guessing game where if you win you get a brownie recipe and if you lose it opens a chocolate cake recipe, where if you guess the wrong number you get three tries with a "too high" "too low" command using if else conditionals
